## Table 9.3: Leading Sentences, mainly test unknown mutation but fall under umbrella terms(Truncating Mutations, Fusion)
### Truncating mutation in oncogene
BRAF	T100*	Unknown	BRAF is considered an oncogene and truncating mutations in oncogenes are typically nonfunctional.
### Truncating mutation in TSG
BRCA1	T100*	Likely Oncogenic	The BRCA1 T100* is a truncating mutation in a tumor suppressor gene, and therefore is likely oncogenic.
### Truncating mutations in TSG that are not curated
PPP2R2A	T100*	Likely Oncogenic	The PPP2R2A T100* is a truncating mutation in a tumor suppressor gene, and therefore is likely oncogenic.
