EGFR	KDD	DUPLICATION	Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer	FALSE	Oncogenic	EGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase, is altered by amplification and/or mutation in lung and brain cancers among others.	The EGFR kinase domain duplication (KDD) alteration is known to be oncogenic.	Multiple case studies have reported that the FDA-approved EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor afatinib has shown clinical activity in patients with EGFR-KDD mutant non-small cell lung cancer.
