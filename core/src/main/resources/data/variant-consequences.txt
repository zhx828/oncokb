#term	generally_truncating	description
transcript_ablation	yes	A feature ablation whereby the deleted region includes a transcript feature
splice_donor_variant	yes	A splice variant that changes the 2 base region at the 5' end of an intron
splice_acceptor_variant	yes	A splice variant that changes the 2 base region at the 3' end of an intron
stop_gained	yes	A sequence variant whereby at least one base of a codon is changed, resulting in a premature stop codon, leading to a shortened transcript
frameshift_variant	yes	A sequence variant which causes a disruption of the translational reading frame, because the number of nucleotides inserted or deleted is not a multiple of three
stop_lost	yes	A sequence variant where at least one base of the terminator codon (stop) is changed, resulting in an elongated transcript
start_lost	yes	A codon variant that changes at least one base of the canonical start codon

inframe_insertion	no	An inframe non synonymous variant that inserts bases into in the coding sequence
inframe_deletion	no	An inframe non synonymous variant that deletes bases from the coding sequence
missense_variant	no	A sequence variant, that changes one or more bases, resulting in a different amino acid sequence but where the length is preserved
splice_region_variant	yes	A sequence variant in which a change has occurred within the region of the splice site, either within 1-3 bases of the exon or 3-8 bases of the intron

regulatory_region_variant	no	A sequence variant located within a regulatory region
feature_elongation	no	A sequence variant that causes the extension of a genomic feature, with regard to the reference sequence
feature_truncation	yes	A sequence variant that causes the reduction of a genomic feature, with regard to the reference sequence

any	no	any variant
coding_transcript_variant	no	A transcript variant of a protein coding gene
protein_altering_variant	no	A sequence_variant which is predicted to change the protein encoded in the coding sequence
sequence_variant	no	A sequence_variant is a non exact copy of a sequence_feature or genome exhibiting one or more sequence_alteration
splice_donor_5th_base_variant	yes	A sequence variant that causes a change at the 5th base pair after the start of the intron in the orientation of the transcript
splice_donor_region_variant	yes	A sequence variant that falls in the region between the 3rd and 6th base after splice junction (5' end of intron)
